## 🎨 Future Enhancements

### Linux-Exclusive Features

Features that go beyond Raycast:

#### 1. Keyboard Maestro-Style Macros ⭐

**Priority:** HIGH - Major differentiator

- Record keyboard sequences
- Multiple trigger types (hotkey, typed string, schedule)
- Variable substitution (`{clipboard}`, `{date}`, `{shell:cmd}`)
- Conditional branching and loops

**MVP Scope:**

- Keyboard recording only (no mouse)
- Hotkey triggers
- Basic actions: type text, key combo, delay, shell command
- Simple variables: `{clipboard}`, `{date}`, `{input}`

#### 2. Scheduled Actions

- Run extensions on timers
- Cron-like scheduling
- Daily digest commands
- Delayed clipboard actions

#### 3. Webhooks / Remote Triggers

- HTTP endpoints trigger commands
- Integration with n8n, Zapier, Home Assistant
- Authentication for security

#### 4. Chained Commands / Pipes

- Command output → next command input
- Visual workflow builder
- Save pipelines as reusable workflows

#### 5. Linux System Integration

- Systemd service control
- DBus-native toggles (faster than shell commands)
- Docker/Podman container management
- Flatpak/Snap integration
